The experiment was a complete success with Steve Rogers' physionomy suddenly raised to the maximum human potential. Unfortunately, at that triumph, the lead scientist was immediately assassinated by a Nazi spy and the formula was irretrievably lost. With Steve Rogers, the US government, aware that war with Nazi Germany was probably imminent, decided to make the most of their resource by appointing him as their propaganda symbol/government agent/superhero, Captain America.

In addition we follow his further adventures after he reemerged in contemporary times out of accidental suspended animation to face all the threats...","type":"Show","day":"Saturday"},
